## UnXSS

Evade Chrome's cross-site scripting (XSS) protection by modifying or deleting websites' security headers on the fly.

For example:

* If you want to load a website in an iframe, and that website uses `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, Chrome will refuse to show the website. Use the "Delete X-Frame-Options header" option to have Chrome ignore that restriction.
* If you want to call a foreign AJAX endpoint from a website that has `Content-Security-Policy: ...` set to disallow wildcard script-src, use the "Delete Content-Security-Policy header" to allow running any script on that page.
* If you want to call out to an API endpoint that doesn't specify itself as `CORS`-friendly, enable the "Add Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * header" and "Add Access-Control-Allow-Methods: * header" options.
* If you want to test a website for reflected XSS vulnerabilities but the page is blocked by the Chrome XSS Auditor due to `X-XSS-Protection: 1` or no `X-XSS-Protection` header present, you can use "Add X-XSS-Protection: 0 header" option to load the page.

Each restriction can be disabled or enabled individually; labeled checkboxes on the configuration page clearly indicate which restrictions are disabled.

The default is to leave all restrictions in place. When you want to allow one or more XSS vectors, click the dark "XSS ☠" icon in the toolbar, and check/uncheck the checkboxes as desired. The restrictions / relaxations take effect immediately, but you will need to refresh any pages that were loaded before disabling the restrictions.


### Installation

UnXSS can be found in the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/unxss).


## Notes

Chrome's developer tools' "Network" inspector shows the original, pre-interception, headers.


## Development

Debugging the `default_popup` page, `options.html`:

    chrome-extension://the_extensions_chrome_id/options.html

Or right-click on the icon in the toolbar and click "Inspect Popup".
